`psymonitor` provides an accessible implementation of the popular real-time monitoring strategy proposed by Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015a,b;PSY), along with a new bootstrap procedure designed to mitigate the potential impact of heteroskedasticity and to effect family-wise size control in recursive testing algorithms (Phillips and Shi, forthcoming). This methodology has been shown effective for bubble and crisis detection (PSY, 2015a,b; Phillips and Shi, 2017) and is now widely used by academic researchers, central bank economists, and fiscal regulators.

## Installation

You can install the **stable** version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psymonitor/index.html)

``` r 
install.packages("psymonitor")
```

You can install the **development** version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/itamarcaspi/psymonitor/)

``` r 
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("itamarcaspi/psymonitor")
```

## Usage

For the illustration purposes we will use data on the credit risk in the European sovereign sector, that is proxied by an index constructed as a GDP weighted 10-year government bond yield of the GIIPS (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) countries, and comes with the 'psymonitor' package.


```{r Rmdsetup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Set global options for runing code chuncks
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,
                      comment = NA)
```

Let’s walk through some basics. First load the `psymonitor` package and get data on GIIPS spread.

```{r data}
library(psymonitor)
data(spread)

```


Next, define a few parameters for the test and the simulation.

```{r setup}
y        <- spread$value
obs      <- length(y)
swindow0 <- floor(obs * (0.01 + 1.8 / sqrt(obs))) # set minimal window size
IC       <- 2  # use BIC to select the number of lags
adflag   <- 6  # set the maximum nuber of lags to 6
yr       <- 2  
Tb       <- 12*yr + swindow0 - 1  # Set the control sample size
nboot    <- 99  # set the number of replications for the bootstrap

```

Next, estimate the PSY test statistic using `PSY()` and its corresponding bootstrap-based critical values using `cvPSYwmboot()`.

```{r test}
bsadf          <- PSY(y, swindow0 = swindow0, IC = IC,
                      adflag = adflag)  # estimate the PSY test statistics sequence

quantilesBsadf <- cvPSYwmboot(y, swindow0 = swindow0, IC = IC,
                              adflag = adflag, Tb = Tb, nboot = 99,
                              nCores = 2) # simulate critical values via wild bootstrap. Note that the number of cores is arbitrarily set to 2.

```

Next, identify crisis periods, defined as periods where the test statistic is above its corresponding critical value, using the `locate()` function.

```{r dateStamp}
dim          <- obs - swindow0 + 1 
monitorDates <- spread$date[swindow0:obs]
quantile95   <- quantilesBsadf %*% matrix(1, nrow = 1, ncol = dim)
ind95        <- (bsadf > t(quantile95[2, ])) * 1
periods      <- locate(ind95, monitorDates)  # Locate crisis periods
```

Finally, print a table that holds the identified crisis periods with the help of the `disp()` function.

```{r printResults}
crisisDates <- disp(periods, obs)  #generate table that holds crisis periods
print(crisisDates)
```
       
|   |  start     |  end       |
